<h1> <i><u>About Me</u></i></h1>
 
<center><p> <b>My name</b> is <mark><strong>Rhys Ashton Pugal Santos</strong></mark>
<b><strong>My Favorite things are</strong></b> <mark><music</mark> <mark>art</mark> and <mark>food</mark>

<center><p><b> <strong>What makes me happy?</strong> <mark>Playing the piano</mark> and <mark>designing clothes</mark> <b>and also having fun with my friends are the things that makes me happy.</b>
<strong>my moto in life</strong>is to <mark>keep on going</mark> and <mark>do not give up</mark> and <strong>do not mind what other people think of you</strong> <i><strong>as long as you are happy</strong></i> and do not compare yourself to other people <mark>cause everyone will shine when it's their time like the sun and moon they both shine when it's their time</mark>

<strong>my plans for the future</strong> is to <mark>graduate</mark> and <mark>have a job</mark> and <mark>keep on making clothes</mark> for fashion <mark>still wanna play piano in a big events</mark> I would like to have my own house and to <mark>travel</mark> all around the world <strong>what did my values change over the years</strong> it changed many things in me like how I acted and back from the past I don't know much things and also I don't know the values of money and I was not matured but now it changed I know the values of money i am matured and I know how to act properly

<strong><b>Who are my family members?</b><strong> I have my <mark>Mom</mark> she takes care of me now but before she is busy of her work all the time that is why my <mark>Lola</mark> takes care of me when she is at work I also have my <mark>Lolo</mark> he spoils me a lot I also have my <mark>Aunties</mark> and <mark>Uncles</mark> their are so caring and also my <mark>Cousins</mark> are really fun to be with

<center><p><b><strong>The most impressive event during my childhood</strong></b> was the time <mark>my Lola and Lolo takes me to the supermarket</mark> and <mark>buys me anything I want and they spoil me with food</mark> and they also take me shopping with them in the mall and buys me toys and every morning <mark>I used to wake up early to watch my favorite childhood movie series the Disney channel and cartoon channell</mark>, <strong><b>the most challenging thing that happened in to my life</b></strong> is <mark>when my Lola died she died cause she thinks too much and also she eats foods that was not allowed that's why one day we took her to the hospital and It took her three months to stay there,</mark> cause she also had a stroke in her whole left side of the body and her brain started to have water until she was pronounced dead she died because of brain damage but it was just that there is also another challenge that happened my family had a big fight about money and inheritance it affected me a lot cause I loved my family and it hurts the fact I didn't just lost my Lola but also my family and but there is still another challenge that happened the <mark>pandemic</mark> no one can go outside because of the virus many people died while we were at home having a bonding the time that happened I stayed with my aunties house and we had fun cause every night we watch movies but sometimes I go back to my mom and have a bonding with her the pandemic was a really hard challenge for everybody and I think that's all:)
